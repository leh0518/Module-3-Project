# Contract Deployment Readme

This readme provides instructions on how to deploy the provided Solidity contract to remix.ethereum.org using a local host network. The contract is a simple token contract that allows minting and burning of tokens, as well as an example function with a requirement.

## Prerequisites
- Internet connection
- Web browser
- remix.ethereum.org account

## Deployment Steps

1. Copy the contract code:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity 0.8.18;

contract Token {
    string public tokenName = "TOKEN";
    string public tokenAbbrv = "TKN";
    uint public totalSupply = 0;
    mapping(address => uint) public balances;

    function mint(address _address, uint _value) public {
        require(_address != address(0), "Invalid address");
        totalSupply += _value;
        balances[_address] += _value;
    }

    function burn(address _address, uint _value) public {
        require(_address != address(0), "Invalid address");
        require(balances[_address] >= _value, "Insufficient balance");

        totalSupply -= _value;
        balances[_address] -= _value;
    }

    function exampleFunction(uint _value) public {
        assert(_value > 0);

        if (_value < 10) {
            revert("Value must be at least 10");
        }
    }
}
```

2. Open your web browser and go to [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org).

3. Once the Remix IDE is loaded, click on the "+" button in the File Explorer panel to create a new file.

4. Paste the copied contract code into the new file.

5. In the Remix IDE, make sure the Solidity compiler version matches the pragma statement in the contract. In this case, set the compiler version to `0.8.18`.

6. Click on the "Compile" tab in the Remix IDE.

7. If the contract compiles successfully without any errors, proceed to the next step. If there are compilation errors, review the error messages and make any necessary corrections to the contract code.

8. Click on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the Remix IDE.

9. From the "Environment" dropdown, select "Injected Web3" to connect to your local host network.

10. Ensure that you have a local Ethereum client running on your machine, such as Ganache, and that it is connected to the same network as Remix.

11. Click on the "Deploy" button next to the contract name.

12. Confirm the transaction in your Ethereum client.

13. Once the contract is successfully deployed, you can interact with it by calling its functions through the Remix IDE interface.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the provided Solidity contract to remix.ethereum.org using a local host network. You can now proceed with testing and utilizing the contract functions as needed.
